# Movies-ETL

I could not able to push csv files to the github as they are large files.

Overview

The project gathers data from both Wikipedia and Kaggle, combines them, and saves them into a SQL database so that it's available as a clean dataset for the end user. MovieLens is a website run by the GroupLens research group at the University of Minnesota. The Kaggle dataset pulls from the MovieLens dataset of over 20 million reviews and contains a metadata file with details about the movies.
